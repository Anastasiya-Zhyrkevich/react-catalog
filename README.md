# Plan

1. Add React.Router https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial
   - Added "/" and "/catalog"
   - Need to create a page for "routes/catalog".
   - Need to add links from the main page
2. Add Providers for JSON data with Mocks. It is an idea of separating fetching data from React rendering.
3. Add Cards and Catalog
4. Render filter block
5. Add Filter functionality (width and height)
6. Add sorting
7. Pagination.
